# Taskforce on Federal Consumer Financial Law

Internal documents produced by the [Taskforce on Federal Consumer Financial Law](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/advisory-committees/taskforce-federal-consumer-financial-law) under CFPB Directory Kathy Kraninger.

> Following an internal review, the Bureau has concluded that the Taskforce on Federal Consumer Financial Law was subject to, and was not operated in compliance with, the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Taskforce's final report therefore should not be relied upon as a product of a federal advisory committee that was established or operated in compliance with FACA.

> On November 29, 2021, the CFPB entered into a stipulated settlement agreement that required, among other corrective actions, the CFPB to release to the plaintiffs by March 22, 2022, all Taskforce records that would have been made public if the CFPB had complied with FACAâ€™s requirements.
